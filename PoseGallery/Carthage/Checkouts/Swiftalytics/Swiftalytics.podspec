                       Swiftalytics lets you use Aspect Oriented Programming to
                       declare all the analytics view tracking for your app on
                       neat one-liners in a single file!

                       * Supports both static and dynamic view tracking
                         * Assign your own closures with correct type inference
                       * Flexible tracking (not forced to viewDidAppear)
                       * Works great with [ARAnalytics](https://github.com/orta/ARAnalytics)
                       * Built for Swift 2.1
