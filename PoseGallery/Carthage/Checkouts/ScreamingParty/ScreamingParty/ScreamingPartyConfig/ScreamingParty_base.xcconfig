CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES = YES



// Defines Module
// 
// If enabled, the product will be treated as defining its own module. This enables
// automatic production of LLVM module map files when appropriate, and allows the product
// to be imported as a module.

DEFINES_MODULE = YES



// Compatibility Version
// 
// Determines the compatibility version of the resulting library, bundle, or framework
// binary.

DYLIB_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION = 1



// Current Library Version
// 
// This setting defines the current version of any framework built by the project. Like
// "Current Project Version", the value must be an integer or floating point number like
// 57 or 365.8. By default it is set to $(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).

DYLIB_CURRENT_VERSION = 1



// Dynamic Library Install Name Base
// 
// Sets the base value for the internal "install path" (LC_ID_DYLIB) in a dynamic
// library. This will be combined with the EXECUTABLE_PATH to form the full install path.
// Setting LD_DYLIB_INSTALL_NAME directly will override this setting. This setting
// defaults to the target's INSTALL_PATH. It is ignored when building any product other
// than a dynamic library. [-install_name]

// Info.plist File
// 
// This is the project-relative path to the plist file that contains the Info.plist
// information used by bundles.

// Installation Directory
// 
// The directory to install the build products in. This path is prepended by the
// 'Installation Build Products Location' (i.e., $(DSTROOT)).

// Runpath Search Paths
// 
// This is a list of paths to be added to the runpath search path list for the image
// being created.  At runtime, dyld uses the runpath when searching for dylibs whose load
// path begins with '@rpath/'. [-rpath]

// Skip Install
// 
// Activating this setting when deployment locations are used causes the product to be
// built into an alternative location instead of the install location.
