 Purpose
--------------
 
 __Purpose the First__ -- To show off how out on the bleeding edge we are to potential clients; yep, we don't just play with Swift, we ship full apps in it, and open source them to boot. This makes us so cool, we superconduct. Go us!
 
 __Purpose the Second__ -- To encourage people to improve our grasp of Swift idioms. As they say, "the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer." [This is called Godwin's Law](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law).
 
 __Purpose the Third__ -- Experimenting with best practices for how to handle what keeps turning out to be a recurring development pattern for us, how to most efficiently ship and maintain branded variations on a common engine. Open sourcing the engine and keeping private the assets of [the shipping App Store branded versions](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/poses-professional-guide-to/id357099619?mt=8&at=10l4B9&ct=SRCreadme), that's pretty much the logical conclusion of that strategy, yes?
