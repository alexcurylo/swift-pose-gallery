 Purpose
--------------
  
Experimenting with best practices for how to handle what keeps turning out to be a recurring development pattern for us, how to most efficiently ship and maintain branded variations on a common engine. Open sourcing the engine and keeping private the assets of [the App Store-shipping branded version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/poses-professional-guide-to/id357099619?mt=8&at=10l4B9&ct=SRCreadme), is pretty much the logical conclusion of that strategy.
 
 Plus demonstrating our current grasp of Swift idioms, and encouraging people to improve said grasp; as they say, "the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer." [This is called Godwin's Law](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law). So if you see anything you figure could be done better, correct away!
